#### Chapter-1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

- Today, Many applications are data-intensive than computation intensive.
- There apps are built from these standard things which solves a common problem.
  - Databases: For storing the data. (SQL, No SQL)
  - Caches: Caching expensive operation for faster reads.
  - Search Indexes: For searching data by keyword.
  - Stream Processing: Handing messages asynchronously.
  - Batch Processing: Processing large amount of accumulated data periodically.

- Different database systems, different characteristics, as different applications have different requirements.
- Multiple approaches for caching and creating search indexes.
- We will read about both principles and practicalities of any data system, and we can use them in our applications. We will see what these data systems have in common, what makes them different and how do they achieve their specific characteristics.
